    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I'm new to video editing and currently focus on editing talking head videos using DaVinci Resolve. I really enjoy bringing stories to life visually and using DaVinci Resolve helps me do that better. I put a lot of effort into making sure the videos are clear and engaging, aiming to capture viewers' attention and deliver meaningful content. I'm always learning and improving my editing skills to create videos that resonate and make an impact.</p>
